<h2>About EAP-TLS</h2>

<p>The Extensible Authentication Protocol (EAP; 
<a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3748">RFC 3748</a>) is a
security protocol that can be used with PPP. It provides a means to
plug in multiple optional authentication methods.<br></p>

<p>Transport Level Security (TLS; TLSv1.3
<a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc8446">RFC 8446</a> and TLSv1.2
<a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5246">RFC 5246</a>) provides for mutual
authentication, integrity-protected ciphersuite negotiation and key
exchange between two endpoints. It also provides for optional MPPE 
encryption.</p>

<p>EAP-TLS (<a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5216">RFC 5216</a>
obsoleting RFC2716) encapsulates the TLS messages in EAP packets,
allowing TLS mutual authentication to be used as a generic EAP
mechanism.</p>

<h2>Why was it written?</h2>

<p>This patch was written to use pppd in a VPN with either PPTP or IPSec/L2TP
and to allow Windows users to authenticate using smartcards with certificates.</p>

<p>Especially for PPTP VPNs the support of EAP-TLS+MPPE is very important, as 
it allows for the use of X.509 certificates to authenticate users. This greatly
improves security (one might say it actually <i>adds</i> a little security), as
the security of the PPTP model is as good as the password/certificate length.

<h2>Latest release</h2>

<p><b>Note</b><br>
As of November 2020, this patch has been merged into the mainline pppd code at
<a href="https://github.com/paulusmack/ppp">https://github.com/paulusmack/ppp</a>.
<br>
For existing releases of pppd up to version 2.4.8 this patch is still available:
<br>
<p>The latest version of this patch with experimental TLSv1.3 support is 
<a href="ppp-2.4.8-eaptls-mppe-1.301.patch">v1.301</a>, released on 28-May-2020.
<p>The latest version of this patch with TLSv1.2 support is 
<a href="ppp-2.4.8-eaptls-mppe-1.202.patch">v1.202</a>, released on 28-May-2020.

</ul>

<h2>Notes</h2>
This patch was originally was developed by Beniamino Galvani in SPE laboratories with
help from Paolo Prandini.
<br>
In 2006 I added MPPE encryption support to the patch and in May 2008 I took over the
maintenance of the patch from Beniamino. Please do not bother him any longer
with questions regarding the EAP-TLS patch.
