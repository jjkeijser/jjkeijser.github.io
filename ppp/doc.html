<h2>Documentation</h2>

The EAP-TLS patch has long been poorly documented. Some resources were available on the internet:

<ul>
  <li>A detailed <a href="http://eaptls.spe.net/doc/tutorial.html">tutorial</a> 
      (in Italian) on how to set up a ppp connection with EAP-TLS between a 
      Linux box and a Windows one using a null-modem cable was once available 
      on the original EAP-TLS site, but seems to have gone missing.
  </li>

  <li>The <a href="README.eap-tls">README.eap-tls</a> file included in patch version v0.995+ provides
      some background and usage information.
  </li>
</ul>

I have made a fresh start with the documentation and have written some (short) HOWTO's on how to build
and configure ppp with EAP-TLS+MPPE support. Comments and feedback are welcome!<br>
The documentation is now split into the following parts:

<ul>
  <li><a href= "doc_building.html">How to build pppd with the EAP-TLS patch</a>
  </li>
  <li><a href= "doc_pki_setup.html">How to set up X.509 certificates using easy-rsa</a>
  </li>
  <li><a href= "doc_pptp_serversetup.html">How to run a Linux PPTP server with X.509 certificate support</a>
  </li>
  <li><a href= "doc_pptp_clientsetup.html">How to run a Linux PPTP client with X.509 certificate support</a>
  </li>
  <li><a href= "doc_pkcs11_setup.html">How to use a PKCS#11 device with a Linux PPTP client</a>
  </li>
  <li><a href= "doc_pptp_winclientsetup.html">Connecting a Windows client to a PPTP server using X.509 certificates</a>
  </li>
  <br>
  <li><a href= "doc_troubleshooting.html">Troubleshooting and sample sessions</a>
  </li>
</ul>

It is not required to use PPTP with the ppp+EAP-TLS patch, but it is the most commonly used setup. It is also
possible to use IPSec + L2TP + ppp+EAP-TLS. This has not yet been documented, but if there's enough demand for it 
I can write it. In theory, such a setup would allow you to use the same set of X.509 certificates for both
the IPSec layer and the L2TP layer.
