<h2>How to use a PKCS#11 device with a Linux PPTP client (smart card and hardware tokens).
</h2>

OpenSSL engine support is included starting with v0.95 of the ppp+EAP-TLS patch.
Currently the only engine tested is the 'pkcs11' engine (hardware token support).
<br>
This tutorial will explain how to use a hardware token for your PPTP VPN certificate/private key
pair.
<br><br>
Before setting up the <tt>pptp</tt> client first make sure that you have created your X.509
certificates. A short tutorial on how to do that is given 
<a href="doc_pki_setup.html">here</a>.

<br><br>
As explained in 
<a href= "doc_pptp_clientsetup.html">How to run a Linux PPTP server with X.509 certificate support</a>,
there are two methods for using pptp + ppp+EAP-TLS:
<ol>
  <li>Using command-line options to specify the public/private keypair and CA certificate</li>
  <li>Using a file <tt>/etc/ppp/eaptls-client</tt> to specify the public/private keypair and CA certificate</li>
</ol>

For PKCS#11 support this is also true, but we will use command-line options here to specify that
the certificate and private key should be retrieved from a hardware token using the PKCS#11 engine.
<br>
The procedure for using the <tt>/etc/ppp/eaptls-client</tt> file in combination with a hardware token
is very similar. 
<br><br>

For this tutorial a SafeNet (formerly Aladdin) eToken PRO 72K was used, in combination with the 
<tt>SafeNetAuthenticationClient 8.1</tt>. Other hardware tokens can also be used, as long as they 
provide a fully functional PKCS#11 interface. A fully opensource PKCS#11 package is 
<a href="https://github.com/OpenSC/OpenSC/wiki">OpenSC</a>. Unfortunately, the eToken PRO 72K is not 
supported, hence we have to resort to the SafeNet driver.


<ul>
  <li><b>Make sure your hardware token is functioning on Linux</b>
  <br>
  This is actually the tricky part in most cases. There are not that many hardware tokens
  or smart cards available that work <em>out of the box</em> on Linux, and configuring the
  driver and tools to use a hardware token can be difficult.
  <br>
  Install the <tt>pcscd</tt>, <tt>engine_pkcs11</tt> and <tt>opensc</tt> packages, as they contain 
  necessary base utilities and tools. We will especially need the <tt>pkcs11-tool</tt> command from 
  the <tt>opensc</tt> package to store the certificate and private key on the hardware token.
  </li>
  <br>
  <li><b>Copy the certificate and private key to the hardware token</b>
  <br>
  Convert the certificate and private key files to DER format and copy them to the token:
<pre>
  $ cd /etc/ppp/keys
  $ openssl x509 -in pptp-client.crt -outform der -out pptp-client-cert.der
  $ pkcs11-tool --module /usr/lib64/libeTPkcs11.so --login --id 12345678 --type cert --w pptp-client-cert.der

  $ openssl rsa -in pptp-client.key -outform der -out pptp-client-key.der
  $ pkcs11-tool --module /usr/lib64/libeTPkcs11.so --login --id 12345678 --type privkey --w pptp-client-key.der
</pre>
  You can use the command
<pre>
  $ pkcs11-tool --module /usr/lib64/libeTPkcs11.so --login -O
</pre>
  to verify that the certificate and private key have been copied to the token. Afterwards you can and should
  delete the .der files.
  </li>
  <br>
  <li><b>Set up the <tt>/etc/ppp/openssl.cnf</tt> file</b>
  <br>
  In order to use the <tt>engine_pkcs11</tt> module with the patched <tt>pppd</tt> command a special
  <tt>/etc/ppp/openssl.cnf</tt> file is needed. The path to this file is hardcoded into the <tt>pppd</tt>
  binary for security reasons.
  <br><br>
  Create an <tt>/etc/ppp/openssl.cnf</tt> file as follows:
<pre>
  openssl_conf = openssl_def
  
  [ openssl_def ]
  engines = engine_section
  
  [ engine_section ]
  pkcs11 = pkcs11_section
  
  [ pkcs11_section ]
  engine_id = pkcs11
  dynamic_path = /usr/lib64/openssl/engines/engine_pkcs11.so
  MODULE_PATH = /usr/lib64/libeTPkcs11.so
  init = 0
</pre>
  (for 32 bit systems adjust <tt>lib64</tt> to <tt>lib</tt>).
  <br>
  It is also possible to hardcode the hardware token password (aka 'PIN') in this file using the 
  option:
<pre>
  PIN = XXXXXXX
</pre>
  <b>NOTE:</b> all keywords in the <tt>openssl.cnf</tt> file are case-sensitive!
  </li>
  <br>
  <li><b>Specify the hardware token using command-line options</b>
  <br>
  To connect to a <tt>pptpd</tt> server named '<tt>pptp.example.com</tt>' using the certificate
  and private key found on the hardware token in slot 0 with ID=12345678 you can use
<pre>
  ./pppd file options-pptp-eaptls \
         cert pkcs11:0:12345678 \
         key  pkcs11:0:12345678 \
         ca   /etc/ppp/keys/ca.crt \
         pty  "pptp pttp.example.com --nolaunchpppd" 
</pre>
  The command will return immediately to the shell prompt.
  <br>
  Check the contents of the <tt>/tmp/pppd.log</tt> file to see the actual connection progress.
  <br>
  If all went well the bottom part of the <tt>/tmp/pppd.log</tt> file should list something like
<pre>
  local  IP address 172.16.1.10
  remote IP address 172.16.1.1
  Script /etc/ppp/ip-up started (pid 29711)
  Script /etc/ppp/ip-up finished (pid 29711), status = 0x0
</pre>
  <b>NOTES:</b>
    <ul>
      <li>the format of the <tt>pkcs11</tt> identifier is
<pre>
  pkcs11:$SLOT_NUMBER:$IDENTIFIER
</pre>
       but the <tt>engine_pkcs11</tt> module also supports formats such as <tt>slot_N_label_XXXX</tt>.
       <br>
       The <tt>pkcs11:</tt> part is needed to tell the <tt>pppd</tt> daemon to look for the 
       certificate or private key on a PKCS#11 device instead of on disk.
       </li>
       <li>it is not required to store the certificate on the hardware token, nor to use the 
       exact same ID or label for the certificate as for the private key. It is very hard, however,
       to find a matching certificate and private key pair on a hardware token if you forget which
       certificate belongs to which private key.
       </li>
       <li>when specifying a pathname for the (CA) certificate or private key, always use a full
       path, e.g.
<pre>
  ca /etc/ppp/keys/ca.crt
</pre>
       Using a path <tt>ca keys/ca.crt</tt> will most likely not work.
       </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <br>
  <li><b>Checking the <tt>pppd.log</tt> connection log</b>
  <br>
  A successful connection log file of a PPTP client with the certificate and private key 
  stored on a hardware token can be found <a href="pppd.log">here</a>.
  <br>
  The most interesting parts are:
<pre>
  Found OpenSSL engine 'pkcs11'
  Found engine identifier '39453945373335312d333545442d343031612d384637302d3238463636393036363042303a30'
  Locating OpenSSL config file
  Loading OpenSSL config file
  Loading OpenSSL built-ins
  Loading OpenSSL configured modules
  Enabling OpenSSL auto engines
  Loading OpenSSL 'pkcs11' engine support
  Initialising engine
  Loading private key '39453945373335312d333545442d343031612d384637302d3238463636393036363042303a30' from engine
  Got the private key, adding it to SSL context
</pre>
  and yes, in this case the ID of the certificate on the token was indeed
  <tt>39453945373335312d333545442d343031612d384637302d3238463636393036363042303a30</tt> :)
