<h2>How to run a Linux PPTP server with X.509 certificate support
</h2>

On Linux it is straightforward to set up a PPTP server using the PoPToP pptpd package, which
can be found in most distro's.
<br>
Before setting up the <tt>pptpd</tt> server first make sure that you have created your X.509
certificates. A short tutorial on how to do this is given 
<a href="doc_pki_setup.html">here</a>

<ul>
  <li><b>Install the PoPToP pptpd package</b>
  <br>
  In most Linux distro's the <tt>pptpd</tt> package is part of the operating system and
  can be installed using your favourite package manager, e.g.
<pre>
    # yum install pptpd
</pre>
  </li>
  <br>
  <li><b>Install the patched pppd binary</b>
  <br>
  Several Linux distro's now include the ppp + EAP-TLS binary out of the box, hence it
  can be installed using a package manager. If this is not the case for your distro then 
  you can install the <tt>pppd</tt> binary manually:
<pre>
  # cd ..../pppd-2.4.6-eaptls/pppd
  # cp pppd /usr/local/sbin
</pre>
  </li>
  <br>
  <li><b>Set up <tt>/etc/pptpd.conf</tt> file</b>
  <br>
  The <tt>pptpd.conf</tt> file contains only a few lines to specify the location of the
  <tt>pppd</tt> binary, the location of the <tt>options-pptpd-eaptls</tt> file and the 
  IP-ranges used for the PPTP server:
<pre>
  ppp /usr/local/sbin/pppd
  option /etc/ppp/options-pptpd-eaptls
  localip 172.16.1.1
  remoteip 172.16.1.10-20 
</pre>
  </li>
  <br>
  <li><b>Set up <tt>/etc/ppp/options-pptpd-eaptls</tt> file</b>
  <br>
  The <tt>options-pptpd-eaptls</tt> file contains all configuration options used
  for starting the <b><tt>pppd</tt></b> daemon.
  <br>
  The name might sound a little misleading, you should/can read it as the
  <em>pppd options file used for starting pptpd with eap-tls support</em>.
  <br><br>
  In 99% of the cases you'll be tweaking this file to make sure your PPTP server is
  running smoothly with EAP-TLS/Certificate support enabled. 
  <br>Here's an example:
<pre>
  name pptp-server
  lock 
  mtu 1500 
  mru 1450
  auth 
  lcp-echo-failure 3 
  lcp-echo-interval 5 
  nodeflate 
  nobsdcomp
  nopredictor1
  nopcomp
  noaccomp
    
  require-eap
  require-mppe-128
   
  debug
  logfile /tmp/pppd.log
</pre>
  The most important options used here are
<pre>
  name pptp-server
  auth 
  require-eap
  require-mppe-128
</pre>
  The <b>name</b> option specifies the name of the service and this name should match the
  second entry in the <tt>eaptls-server</tt> file. It is also useful to make this name
  equal to the /CN= part of the <tt>pptp-server.crt</tt> file. 
  <br>
  The <b>auth</b> option determines that the other end should authenticate itself. This
  option, together with the next one,  more or less put <tt>pppd</tt> into 'server mode'
  and not in 'client mode'.
  <br>
  The <b>require-eap</b> option specifies that the other end should do EAP authentication.
  <br>
  Finally, the <b>require-mppe-128</b> option specifies that we only want to do MPPE
  encryption using 128 bit ciphers. 
  <br>
  <br>
  <b>NOTE</b>: If you want to test the new TLSv1.3 handshake protocol, then make sure you have compiled 
  and linked the pppd-eap-tls code against an OpenSSL version that supports TLSv1.3 and add an extra line
<pre>
  max-tls-version 1.3 
</pre>
  to both client and server configurations.
  </li>
  <br>
  <li><b>Set up <tt>/etc/ppp/eaptls-server</tt> file</b>
  <br>
  The last file that needs to be set up before the PPTP service can be started is the 
  <tt>eaptls-server</tt> file. The path for this file is hardcoded into  <tt>pppd</tt>
  for security reasons (a non-root user might otherwise gain root access under certain
  rare circumstances). 
  <br>
  Into this file insert a line for each server instance with which you use EAP-TLS.
  <br>
  It is also possible to list the same server instance multiple times with different
  client identities, so that you can use different IP addresses for different clients,
  while still using a single PPTP server instance.
  <br>
  The format of each line is:
    <ul>
      <li><em>Client name</em>:
      the name used by the client for authentication, can be *
      </li>
      <li><em>Server name</em>:
      the name of the server, can be *
      </li>
      <li><em>Client certificate file</em>:
      if you want to specify the certificate that the client is required to use,
      put the certificate file name, else put a dash '-'.
      </li>
      <li><em>Server certificate file</em>:
      the file containing the certificate chain for the server in PEM format.
      </li>
      <li><em>CA certificate file</em>:
      the file containing the trusted CA certificates in PEM format.
      </li>
      <li><em>Server private key file</em>:
      the file containing the server private key in PEM format.
      </li>
      <li><em>Addresses</em>:
      a list of IP addresses the client is allowed to use. This address should be within the 
      range of IP addresses that is listed in the <tt>/etc/pptpd.conf</tt> file.
    </ul>
  For this example the following file was used:
<pre>
  *  pptp-server  -  /etc/ppp/keys/pptp-server.crt  /etc/ppp/keys/ca.crt  /etc/ppp/keys/pptp-server.key  *
</pre>
  <b>NOTE</b> If you're puzzled about the (lack of) logic in the order of these options: the order has 
  grown historically and cannot be easily modified without breaking existing setups.
  </li>
  <br>
  <li><b>Run the daemon</b>
  <br>
  Running the <tt>pptpd</tt> daemon is just a matter of using
<pre>
  # pptpd --conf /etc/ppp/pptpd.conf
</pre>
  Or you can use system provided service scripts as well, such as
<pre>
  # service pptpd start
</pre>
  When the <tt>pptpd</tt> daemon starts it will not launch a <tt>pppd</tt> process directly, this 
  will happen when a client attempts to make a connection. Thus, after starting the <tt>pptpd</tt>
  process it is rarely needed to restart it again. Modifications made to the <tt>options-pptpd-eaptls</tt>
  file are automatically picked up when the next client connects.
  </li>
</ul>
